# [NHS AI Lab Skunkworks’ project: Data Lens](https://www.nhsx.nhs.uk/ai-lab/explore-all-resources/develop-ai/data-lens-a-fast-access-data-search-in-multiple-languages/)

> A pilot project for the NHS AI Lab Skunkworks team, Data Lens brings together information about multiple databases, providing a fast-access search in multiple languages

As the successful candidate from a Dragons’ Den-style project pitch, Data Lens was first picked as a pilot project for the NHS AI (Artificial Intelligence) Lab Skunkworks team in September 2020.

The pitch outlined a common data problem for analysts and researchers across the UK: large volumes of data held on numerous incompatible databases in different organisations. The team wanted to be able to quickly source relevant information with one search engine.

## Intended Purpose

This proof of concept ([TRL 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_readiness_level)) is intended to demonstrate the technical validity of applying Natural Language Processing to a range of NHS datasets in order to provide intelligent search functionality. It is not intended for deployment in a clinical or non-clinical setting without further development and compliance with the [UK Medical Device Regulations 2002](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2002/618/contents/made) where the product qualifies as a medical device.

## Data Protection

This project was subject to a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA), ensuring the protection of the data used in line with the [UK Data Protection Act 2018](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/contents/enacted) and [UK GDPR](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/dp-at-the-end-of-the-transition-period/data-protection-and-the-eu-in-detail/the-uk-gdpr/). No data or trained models are shared in this repository.

## How Data Lens works
Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and other AI technologies, the Data Lens project is creating a universal search engine for health and social care data catalogues and metadata. By providing user friendly access to previously time consuming separate data catalogues, Data Lens aims to:

- present information about data from across the sector with one search
- give preview information and direct users to an original location (avoiding the need for another database)
- provide multilingual support and a user focused approach
- reduce workload and improve the quality of information available
- build up a picture of what data is collected and how it flows through the health and social care system

## Why Data Lens is needed
The health and social care sector has huge amounts of data, spread across many NHS organisations and even more databases. When searching for information it can often be difficult to find out whether it exists, and where it is. Searching and cross referencing multiple data catalogues can also be extremely time consuming. 

This project helps to join up health and social care by enabling cross organisational views of data. The tool will also promote inclusivity and allow access to a variety of users, with language support where possible for Welsh, Polish, Urdu, and Punjabi.

Using artificial intelligence to power this search engine reduces the time required to make the most of existing data sets, and answers the call from the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care to turbo charge data responsiveness and ease the burden of data collection across the health and care system.

The NHS AI Lab is working with the Home Office programme: [Accelerated Capability Environment (ACE)](https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/accelerated-capability-environment-ace) to choose a supplier to complete this project, providing access to a large pool of talented and experienced suppliers who pitch their own vision for the project.

Data Lens currently joins up five data catalogues from across the NHS system including NHS England and Improvement, NHS Digital, and Public Health England. The project is now entering a testing phase where searches will be used to train the search engine, and feedback implemented to improve the user experience.

## NHS AI Lab Skunkworks
The project is supported by the NHS AI Lab Skunkworks, which exists within the NHS AI Lab to support the health and care community to rapidly progress ideas from the conceptual stage to a proof of concept.
